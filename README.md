# Hate Speech Detection on Social Media Using AI

## Description
This project focuses on detecting hate speech and offensive language on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models like BERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet. Two training strategies were implemented: freezing transformer layers and fine-tuning the entire model. Results demonstrated the superior performance of fully fine-tuned models, with RoBERTa achieving the best outcomes. The project provides a foundation for enhancing online safety through automated hate speech detection.

## Features
- Detection of hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content.
- Comparison of training strategies: partial vs. full fine-tuning.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Languages
- **Project Language**: English
- **Programming Language**: Python

## Keywords
Hate speech, NLP, social media, transformers, Twitter, deep learning, BERT, RoBERTa, BERTweet

## Future Work
- Integration with multilingual datasets for broader application.
- Training on larger datasets for improved generalization.
- Real-world deployment and interpretability enhancements.
